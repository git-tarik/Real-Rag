NexusRAG: State-of-the-Art Open Source RAG Pipeline🚀 Project OverviewNexusRAG is a next-generation Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline designed to achieve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance using entirely open-source components.Moving beyond naive RAG (simple vector search), this project implements Advanced RAG patterns including Hybrid Search (Sparse + Dense), Cross-Encoder Reranking, and Agentic Reasoning. The goal is to create a hallucination-resistant, high-precision Q&A system capable of handling complex document structures.✨ Key Features⚡ Hybrid Search: Combines dense vector retrieval (semantic meaning) with sparse keyword search (BM25) to capture both conceptual understanding and exact terminology match.🧠 SOTA Open Source LLM: Powered by DeepSeek-V3 (via Ollama/vLLM), delivering GPT-4 class performance locally or via open API.🎯 Cross-Encoder Reranking: Utilizes BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3 to re-score retrieved context, significantly improving precision before the context hits the LLM.📊 Robust Embeddings: Uses BAAI/bge-m3 for multi-lingual, multi-granularity embeddings (dense, sparse, and ColBERT-style).🏗️ Modular Architecture: Built with LlamaIndex for easy swapping of components (vector stores, LLMs, embedders).🐳 Containerized: Fully dockerized stack (Vector DB + App + LLM Server) for instant deployment.🛠️ Tech StackThis pipeline is built on the "Modern Open Source AI Stack" (2025/2026 standards):ComponentTechnologyWhy this choice?OrchestrationLlamaIndexSuperior to LangChain for data indexing, recursive retrieval, and complex RAG patterns.LLMDeepSeek-V3The current SOTA for open-source reasoning and coding, rivaling proprietary top-tier models.EmbeddingBAAI/bge-m3Supports dense, sparse, and multi-vector retrieval in a single model.Vector DBQdrantHigh-performance, Rust-based, native support for Hybrid Search and highly scalable.Rerankerbge-reranker-v2A Cross-Encoder that drastically reduces hallucinations by filtering irrelevant retrieved chunks.UIChainlitA "ChatGPT-like" UI built specifically for Python RAG apps; faster to build than Streamlit.InferenceOllamaLocal LLM hosting for privacy and zero API costs during development.🏗️ Architecture & Implementation IdeaThe pipeline follows an "Ingest -> Index -> Retrieve -> Rank -> Generate" workflow:Ingestion & Chunking:Documents (PDF, Markdown, TXT) are ingested.Semantic Chunking is applied (instead of fixed character splitting) to keep related text together.Hybrid Indexing:Chunks are embedded into dense vectors using bge-m3.Simultaneously, a sparse inverted index (BM25) is built for keyword matching.Both are stored in Qdrant.Retrieval Engine:Query is processed to generate both a vector and keyword extraction.System fetches the top k results from both indices (Dense + Sparse).Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) combines these results into a single candidate list.Reranking (The "Secret Sauce"):The top candidates (e.g., 20 chunks) are passed to the Cross-Encoder Model.The model scores each chunk's relevance to the specific query.Only the top 5 highly relevant chunks are sent to the LLM.Generation:DeepSeek-V3 synthesizes the answer based strictly on the reranked context.💾 Installation & SetupPrerequisitesDocker & Docker ComposePython 3.11+NVIDIA GPU (Recommended for local LLM inference)1. Clone the RepositoryBashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/NexusRAG.git
cd NexusRAG
2. Environment SetupCreate a .env file:Bashcp .env.example .env
Tip: If using Ollama locally, no API keys are required.3. Run with DockerSpin up the Vector DB (Qdrant) and the App:Bashdocker-compose up -d --build
4. Install Local Dependencies (For development)Bashpip install poetry
poetry install
🚀 UsageStart the UI:Bashchainlit run app.py -w
Ingest Documents:Place your PDFs in the data/ directory. The ingestion script acts as a watcher or can be triggered manually:Bashpython src/ingest.py
Chat:Open http://localhost:8000 to interact with your RAG pipeline.🔮 Future Roadmap[ ] Agentic RAG: Implement a routing agent that can decide whether to search the vector DB or use a web search tool (Serper/Tavily).[ ] GraphRAG: Integrate Knowledge Graphs (Neo4j) to capture relationships between entities across documents.[ ] Multimodal Support: Upgrade to Qwen3-VL to support querying images and charts within PDFs.Author: [Your Name]University: Central University of JharkhandNext StepWould you like me to generate the docker-compose.yml and the requirements.txt files for this stack so you can immediately start building?AWS re:Invent 2025 - Advanced RAG ArchitecturesThis video from AWS re:Invent covers the advanced architectural patterns (like Agentic RAG and Recursive Retrieval) that are essential for understanding the "Best RAG" concepts implemented in this project.
